Show results under various parameters (e.g. filter length) and make some plots that demonstrate the effects of these parameters.

Being able to listen at a sound and identify what’s wrong and how to fix it is a big part of audio processing.\n",

    "For this part we will design a simple graphic equalizer. We will do so using a more straightforward approach as opposed to a bank of filters as discussed in class.\n",

    "We want to make an equalizer which contains six bands with center frequencies at 100Hz, 200Hz, 400Hz, 800Hz, 1600Hz and 3200Hz. Your equalizer function will take two inputs, one for the input sound and a 6-element gain vector that will indicate how much to boost or suppress each frequency band. Use the ```scipy.signal.firwin2``` function to design a filter that has the desired characteristics. For various settings of the gain vector, use the ```scipy.signal.freqz``` command to plot the response of the filter and verify that it behaves as indicated. Experiment with various filter lengths and see which works best.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you figure that out, design a graphic equalizer with as many bands as you like (and arbitrary center frequencies as well), and use it to solve the problems in part 1 again. The only thing that should be different in the EQ for each recording should be the gains for each band. Play the output sounds, and show the spectrograms, see how they compare with your previous solutions.\n",
